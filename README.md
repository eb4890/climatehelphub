#Climate Help hub
====

## Hypothesis
====

It is hard to find out how to help fight climate change.

## Proposed Solution
====

Climate help hub (tentative title) fill the need of having a central place to go to find out how to help with the climate crisis.

It is partially inspired by the success of the GOV.UK digital transformation where a single place was created for people who wanted to interact with government.

The difference will be that it is community managed and global (being localised for different regions based on IP), rather than centralised.

There may be different ways to interact with this hub. From searching it, directory navigation, to being asked questions. User research will be used to determine the ways people want to interact with this information.

## Current status 

1. Run a design sprint
2. Contact possible community members
